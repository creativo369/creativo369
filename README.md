# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm Victor Gonzalez

  A student of Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic Faculty of the National University of Asuncion.

ðŸŽ“ During this university stage I've been able to develop my skills in the areas of Development and Project Management.

I have 3 years of experience and I specialize in the field of software development where I make use of my skills and abilities in the analysis, design, creation, testing and maintenance of software.

It covers a wide range of activities and technical skills from backend to frontend where my main goal and vision is to build complete solutions as required. It is a field that I am very passionate about as it challenges, strengthens, develops and exploits my skills by testing my soft skills in both technical and non-technical problem solving and helps me to constantly learn something new.
